# D3 Visualization for US-Pollution Data
## Objective
This project considers the potential health risk of exposure to various concentrations of atmospheric pollutants. A visualization interface is used to analyze air quality index (AQI) data, from the US Pollution Dataset, collected from 2000 to 2016, which contains daily measurements of four major pollutants, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O3), compiled by location. The objective, of the analysis, is to identify regions reporting air pollutant measurements at levels historically known to have positively correlated statistically significant mortality rate predictions. 

## Visualizations
The homepage can be seen listing all possible air pollution visualizations offered.
Visualizations for Nation-Wide Air Pollutant Analysis
For nation-wide air pollution analysis, there are two visualizations implemented. The first is a tree map comparing average pollution levels of each state, while the second utilizes choropleth maps for each pollutant, displaying the level of the chosen pollutant on a map of the United States.
Visualizing Air Pollutant Levels by State and County also Included.
Visualization for the state of North Carolina which include Interactive Bar charts and line graphs.
